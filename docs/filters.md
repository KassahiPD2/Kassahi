# Filters

## Types of filters

There are three main categories:

-   **Crafters**: This was used for crafting season. It's now outdated.
-   **Regular**: These are the filters that are used for regular seasons. Most up-to-date.
-   **Meme**: Based off regular, but will have suprising names :)

### Hyper and Non-Hyper filters

Hyper filters are more dramatic and have more stylized look, whereas Non-Hyper filters are more subtle.
